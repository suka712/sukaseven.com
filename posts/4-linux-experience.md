### If you have a computer running Windows, install Linux

That's what I did. Downloaded the `.iso`, flash it to a USB stick and install it from there - alll **under half an hour**. 

Never installed an OS before, I didn't know what flashing, bootloading is, but there is Google and a couple hundred Youtube tutorials on how to install the thing.

So you basically just need a USB stick with 5GB of storage and the ability to click buttons for this transformative experience. 

### The Linux experience

I installed a version (or distro) of `Linux` called `Linux Mint` at first. What I realized in the first 18 hours of running the thing was
- There is no ads on the thing `:0`. No Candy Crush in the Menu.
- Battery life tripled. This 3 year old laptop went from needing constant plugging to lasting **half a day on a single charge**. This is definitely due to there being less spyware funneling your data to Mircrosoft.
- The entire OS is 26GB compared to 60GB of MacOS and a hunking 90GB of Windows.
- Everything is an app. The taskbar is an app, the menu bar is an app, the emoji selector is an app. You can actually uninstall it.
- Full control over everything. There is a setting to set key repeat delay to 0ms, a setting to push volume beyond 100%.
- The control is similar to Windows. Nothing to complain here. I love the Control + Shift binds on Windows and the Window + numKeys to navigate.
- File system and everything is similar to that of MacOS. Same file system, same shell.

### The Manjaro experience

After playing with Mint for 18 hours, I got the suggestion of installing a version of `Arch Linux` called `Manjaro`. It is like Arch with training wheels where you are forced to learn a lot about computer and apps but you have everything working out the box.

- There is no `.exe`, no `.app`, no `.deb` you can download to install apps like you would on other OS (or other Linux variant). You want VSCode? Open the terminal, `yay -S visual-studio-code-bin`, enter your password and watch it go. Need Spotify? `yay -S spotify`. No idea where they are pulling these from but yea, that's how you install stuff.
- `I use Arch btw` and some would actually *wow* at the workflow and how bare the desktop look.

### It's like...

...MacOS but with better keyboard layout and more "hacker-looking".

Not like Windows at all actually.

Pretty cool.
