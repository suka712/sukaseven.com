### Arch Linux made me discover .zshrc

...Manjaro actually. There should be a post before this one talking about my journey into the world of Linux.
Linux made me use the terminal a lot more frequently, look around in dotfiles and I discovered that whatever is inside of the `.zshrc` in your home folder would run for every new terminal session.

I haven't done much customization yet but I got ChatGPT to make a custom prompt.
The command thing inside reads `PROMPT='%F{red}%n%f@%F{cyan}%m%f %F{white}%~%f %F{cyan}$%f '` 

which somehow translates to
```
khiem@Khiems-Macbook ~$ Repos/sukaseven.com
```
...with color. And I got a cat to appear at the start of my terminal session.
```
        ✦        .       -                     ✧
+     .      +     \      .;'';,    .     . ,;'':;,    consider

### Mac and Linux shares the same Z Shell config
I learned that the terminal on Mac is basically the same as the one on Linux, they both offer Zsh and Bash (which stands for Borne Again Shell btw). So whichever runs on this machine would also run on Linux. Apparently these are both POSIX-compliant systems or something.

Besides the shell, they share a lot in common, the file structure, the twelve lines of echo that gave the cat its shape work on both machines.

So both of my computers share the same default prompt and the cat at the start.

And `neofetch` on Mac and `screenfetch` on Manjaro are CLI (commandline interface) tools that can be installed on both systems to display the cool looking OS thing at the start also

There's also this thing

This little bit of discovery hopefully is the end of the customization rabbithole for me.
