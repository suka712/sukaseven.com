# Well, welcome

These are the first few words from this blog. It feels a little silly broadcasting stuff here. But whatever.
Even if it reaches nobody, it at least helps me keep track of the shit I pick up throughout the months and year.

# What to expect here?

- As for the technical stuff, it's mainly going to be web dev knowledge that I picked up.
- Personal projects both technical and creative. I make small apps and I also draw if you didn't know.
- Ideas. Shit I picked up as I live out this life that might prove useful sometimes.

Alright. I guess that's all for the first post.
