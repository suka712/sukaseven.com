## hey, i'm khiem

this is my workstation. not a portfolio template — a living dashboard that grows as i ship.

### currently building

- **katanaid** — identity & auth platform
- **caphne** — real-time collaboration tool
- **anyu** — s3-compatible file service
- **hasaki-go** — high-performance API framework in Go

### how this works

click around the file tree on the left to explore projects, tools, and experience. each entry is a devlog — what it is, why i built it, how it works, and what broke along the way.

the terminal at the bottom accepts commands. try `help` to see what's available.

### stack

this site: next.js, tailwind, mdx. backend: go, postgres, railway. everything ships fast or doesn't ship at all.
