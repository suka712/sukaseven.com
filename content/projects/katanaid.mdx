## what it is

katanaid is an identity and authentication platform. email OTP, session management, API key provisioning — the auth layer i use across all my projects.

## why i built it

every side project needed auth. copy-pasting auth code between projects was a nightmare. katanaid centralizes it — one service handles identity for everything.

## how it works

- **Go backend** handles OTP generation, verification, session tokens
- **Postgres** stores users, sessions, API keys
- **Redis** for OTP temp storage and rate limiting
- **Next.js** frontend for the management dashboard

auth flow: user enters email → backend generates OTP → sends via SMTP → user verifies → session token issued.

## technical challenges

the hardest part was getting token refresh right without race conditions. multiple tabs could trigger simultaneous refresh requests, invalidating each other's tokens. solved it with a mutex-style lock using Redis.
